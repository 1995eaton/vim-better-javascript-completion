Installation
============

Just throw this folder in your `.vim`/`bundle` directory. This should automatically replace Vim's existing JavaScript completion plugin

Features
========

 * Much more up-to-date completion including support for many HTML5 methods/globals
 * HTML5 canvas -> getContext completion
 * NodeIterator, Treewalker, localStorage/sessionStorage methods
 * All of the existing methods were updated including the `.style` completions (webkit supported), and `console.` object
